# CropYieldForecastML
This repository showcases the final project from the DTU Advanced Business Analytics course.

**Motivation**
  - Address the increasing significance of crop yield issues in the current landscape of global climate change.
  - Forecast crop yields considering the impact of climate change and rising energy costs on the supply side, and the growing demand for food, feed, and fuel on the demand side.

**Analysis**
  - Utilized data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Bank.
  - Examined historical yield and increase of major crops.
  - Employed machine learning techniques, particularly decision tree regression, to forecast crop yields.

**Results**
  - Identified potatoes, cassava, and sweet potatoes as significant influencers of crop yield, with potatoes yielding up to 20 tons per hectare.
  - Found pesticide usage to be the third most influential factor, with a slight positive correlation between pesticide application and yield.
  - Highlighted precipitation and average temperature as critical factors influencing yield.

**Implications**
  - Recommended optimizing crop selection and cultivation, investing in research for new crop varieties, establishing smart pesticide management, implementing adaptive water resource management, and adopting climate-adaptive farming practices to mitigate the negative effects of climate change on yields.
